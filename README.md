**Objective:** 
Write a Java program for a public community garden at Moreno Valley College. Moreno Valley residents can register and schedule an appointment to visit the garden. The community garden operates 8:00 AM – 8:00 PM, Monday – Friday and 8:00 AM – 5:00 PM on Saturday. During each appointment, patrons can pick fresh produce, fruits and vegetables, at this garden at no cost.
